Amazon Smiley
=============

A Firefox extension that automatically loads Amazon Smile (using HTTPS)
when you navigate to an Amazon page, in order to donate a portion of your
purchase to the charity of your choice.

This extension works with Firefox Quantum, and supports amazon.com,
amazon.co.uk, and amazon.de, which are the only three Amazon country
sites that support Smile as of November 2017.

There are no configuration options, and the extension asks for only
the minimum privileges needed to redirect requests.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome. This is my first
Firefox extension.
