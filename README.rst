Amazon Smiley
=============

A Firefox and Chrome extension that automatically loads Amazon Smile
(using HTTPS) when you navigate to an Amazon page, in order to have
Amazon donate a portion of your purchase to the charity of your choice.

In addition to the main 'amazon.com' site, the extension will work on
the UK (`amazon.co.uk`) and German (`amazon.de`) Amazon sites as well.
There aren't any other country-specific Amazon sites that support
Smile as of late 2017.

The extension requires Firefox version 57 (released November 2017)
or newer to run under Firefox, or any recent Chrome version to run
under Chrome.

It can be installed for Firefox through the normal Firefox add-on
mechanism:

For Chrome, you can download this repo, and in Chrome, on the
`chrome://extensions` page, check the 'Developer mode' checkbox
at the top and then choose 'Load unpacked extension...' and
select the base directory of this repo to load the extension.

The extension asks for only the minimum privileges needed to redirect
requests.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome. This is my first
browser extension.
